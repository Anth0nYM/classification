# Classification notebook

Classification ActivityActivity developed in the Intelligent Systems course during the Master's Degree in Computer Science

## Proposed Activity

The proposed activity is the analysis and classification of web pages for phishing and malicious activity detection. For this purpose, public datasets available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielfernandon/web-page-phishing-dataset/data) were used

### Data Preprocessing

This step involves preprocessing the data before using it for model training.

### Custom KNN Classifier

We will implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model from scratch, without relying on external libraries. This allows for a deeper understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.

### Comparison with scikit-learn Classifiers

We will compare the performance of our custom KNN model with four other pre-built classifiers available in the scikit-learn library. This will help us evaluate the effectiveness of our implementation.

### K-Fold Cross-Validation and Evaluation Metrics

We will employ the K-fold cross-validation technique to assess the robustness and generalizability of our models. Additionally, we will define appropriate metrics to quantify the performance of each classifier.
